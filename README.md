# Norms-R-Us - 
Norms-R-Us is a frontend normal distribution graph generator written in typescript + react, and features the recharts library.

Users can enter gaussian distribution parameters for one or more distributions and compare and contrast the results.  The probability that an observation will be found above or below a point on the curve can also be calculated for each distribution. See below for an example usage of the UI
